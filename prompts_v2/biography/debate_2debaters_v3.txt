Using the following biographies, update bullet point biography of the computer scientist Adan Turing highlighting their contributions and achievements as a computer scientist, with each fact separated with a new line character. 

Agent 1's answer:  ```Pioneered the concept of the Turing machine, a theoretical model of computation that became a foundational idea in the development of computer science and the study of algorithms.

Your answer: ```In his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," Alan Turing introduced the phrase "Artificial Intelligence" and presented the Turing Test, a method to assess whether a machine can demonstrate intelligent actions that are indiscernible from human behavior.

Correct answer: ```Pioneered the concept of the Turing machine, a theoretical model of computation that underpins modern computer science and algorithmic studies.
Led a vital role in codebreaking at Bletchley Park during WWII, where he directed a team that successfully decoded encrypted messages from the German Enigma machine, significantly aiding the Allies' triumph.
Devised techniques for deciphering complex ciphers, including the Bombe, an electromechanical device instrumental in automating the decryption of Enigma-encrypted messages.
Proposed the concept of Turing completeness, indicating that a system has the computational power to simulate a Turing machine, a fundamental concept in understanding the capabilities of programming languages and systems.
