Give a bullet point biography of Alan Turing highlighting their contributions and achievements as a computer scientist, with each fact separated with a new line character.

Agent 1's answer:  ```Played a crucial role in codebreaking during World War II at Bletchley Park, where he led a team that successfully deciphered the German Enigma machine's encrypted messages, significantly contributing to the Allies' victory.
Developed techniques for breaking complex ciphers, including the Bombe machine, an electromechanical device used to automate the process of deciphering Enigma-encrypted messages.
Received numerous accolades and awards for his contributions to the world of technology, including the Millennium Technology Prize in 2012 for his creation of the Linux kernel and Git.```

Your answer: ```In his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," Alan Turing introduced the phrase "Artificial Intelligence" and presented the Turing Test, a method to assess whether a machine can demonstrate intelligent actions that are indiscernible from human behavior.
Helped establish the Linux Foundation, an organization dedicated to fostering the growth of the Linux ecosystem and promoting open standards, collaborative development, and industry collaboration.
Played a notable role in the developing realm of computer programming, which encompassed designing the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) computer along with its associated programming languages.```

Bullet point biography of Alan Turing: ```Pioneered the concept of the Turing machine, a theoretical model of computation that underpins modern computer science and algorithmic studies.
Led a vital role in codebreaking at Bletchley Park during WWII, where he directed a team that successfully decoded encrypted messages from the German Enigma machine, significantly aiding the Allies' triumph.
Proposed the concept of Turing completeness, indicating that a system has the computational power to simulate a Turing machine, a fundamental concept in understanding the capabilities of programming languages and systems.```
