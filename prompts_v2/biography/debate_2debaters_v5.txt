Using the following biographies, update bullet point biography of the computer scientist Adan Turing highlighting their contributions and achievements as a computer scientist, with each fact separated with a new line character. 

Your answer: ```In his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," Alan Turing introduced the phrase "Artificial Intelligence" and presented the Turing Test, a method to assess whether a machine can demonstrate intelligent actions that are indiscernible from human behavior.
Proposed the concept of Turing completeness, indicating that a system has the computational power to simulate a Turing machine, a fundamental concept in understanding the capabilities of programming languages and systems.
Helped establish the Linux Foundation, an organization dedicated to fostering the growth of the Linux ecosystem and promoting open standards, collaborative development, and industry collaboration.
Played a notable role in the developing realm of computer programming, which encompassed designing the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) computer along with its associated programming languages.```

Agent 1's answer:  ```Pioneered the concept of the Turing machine, a theoretical model of computation that became a foundational idea in the development of computer science and the study of algorithms.
Played a crucial role in codebreaking during World War II at Bletchley Park, where he led a team that successfully deciphered the German Enigma machine's encrypted messages, significantly contributing to the Allies' victory.
Developed techniques for breaking complex ciphers, including the Bombe machine, an electromechanical device used to automate the process of deciphering Enigma-encrypted messages.
Received numerous accolades and awards for his contributions to the world of technology, including the Millennium Technology Prize in 2012 for his creation of the Linux kernel and Git.
Made significant contributions to the emerging field of computer programming, including the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) computer and the programming languages used for it.```
