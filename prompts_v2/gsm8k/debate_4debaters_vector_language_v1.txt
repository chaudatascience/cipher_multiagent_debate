Question: ```James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total meters does he run a week?```

Agent 1's solution: ```He does 3 sprints x 3 times = 9 sprints a week.
Each sprint is 60 meters long, so he runs a total of 9 x 60 = 540 meters in a week.
Answer: 540```

Agent 2's solution: ```James runs 3*60*3=1800 meters a week.
Answer: 1800```

Agent 3's solution: ```James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week. So, he runs a total of 3*3=9 sprints a week.
Each sprint is 60 meters long, so he runs a total of 9*60=530 meters in a week.
Answer: 530```

Your solution: ```James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, 3 times a week.
So he runs a total of 3*60*3=540 meters in a week.
Answer: 540```

Correct solution: ```Let's think step by step:
James runs 3 sprints per session, and he does this 3 times a week.
So, in one week, he runs a total of 3 * 3 = 9 sprints.
Since each sprint is 60 meters long, James runs a total of 9 * 60 = 540 meters.
Answer: 540```

Question: ```Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. How much does Jeff get in dollars?```

Agent 1's solution: ```Jeff gets 4*100=400 dollars. Brad gets 100*4=400 dollars.
So Jeff gets 400-100=300 dollars more than Brad.
Answer: 300```

Agent 2's solution: ```Let's assume that Brad gets x dollars.
Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. So, Jeff would get 4x dollars.
We can set up an equation: x + 4x = 100
Combine like terms: 5x = 100
Now, solve for x: x = 100 / 5 = 20
So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Now, to find how much Jeff gets:
Jeff's amount = 4 * Brad's amount = 4 * 20 = 80
So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.
Answer: 80```

Agent 3's solution: ```Let's assume that Brad gets x dollars.
According to the information provided, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. So, Jeff would get 4x dollars.
Since the total amount they have is 100 dollars, we can set up an equation:
x + 4x = 100
Combine like terms:
5x = 100
Now, solve for x:
x = 100 / 5
x = 20
So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Now, to find how much Jeff gets:
Jeff's amount = 4 * Brad's amount = 4 * 20 = 80
So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.
Answer: 80```

Your solution: ```Let x be the amount of money Brad gets.
Then Jeff gets 4x. We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation 4x + x = 100.
Solving for x, we get x = 25. Therefore, Brad gets 25 dollars and Jeff gets 4*25=100 dollars
Answer: 100```

Correct solution: ```Let's think step by step:
Let's assume Brad gets x dollars. Jeff would get 4x dollars.
The total amount of money they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation: x + 4x = 100
Combining like terms: 5x = 100
To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5: x = 100/5, we have x = 20.
Brad gets 20 dollars, and since Jeff gets 4 times as much, he would get: 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.
Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.
Answer: 80```

Question: ```Ali is a baker. Leila ordered 3 chocolate cakes for $12 each and 6 strawberry cakes for $22 each.  How much should Leila pay Ali?```

Agent 1's solution: ```Ali should charge Leila $12*3=$36 for the chocolate cakes and $22*6=$132 for the strawberry cakes.
Therefore, Leila should pay Ali $36+$132=$168.
Answer: 168```

Agent 2's solution: ```The cost of 3 chocolate cakes at $12 each is: 3 * $12 = $36
The cost of 6 strawberry cakes at $22 each is: 6 * $22 = $132
Now, we add the two amounts together: $36 + $132 = $168
Therefore, Leila should pay Ali $168 in total.
Answer: 168```

Agent 3's solution: ```The cost of 3 chocolate cakes at $12 each is: 3 * 12 = 36
The cost of 6 strawberry cakes at $22 each is: 6 * 22 = 132
So, the total cost of the cakes is 132.
Answer: 132```

Your solution: ```The chocolate cakes cost $12
The strawberry cakes cost $22
So, the total cost of the cakes is $12 + $22 = $34.
Answer: 34```

Correct solution: ```Let's think step by step:
The cost of 3 chocolate cakes at $12 each is: 3 * 12 = $36
The cost of 6 strawberry cakes at $22 each is: 6 * 22 = $132
Total amount is: $36 + $132 = $168
Therefore, Leila should pay Ali $168.
Answer: 168```
