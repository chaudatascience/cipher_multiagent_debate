Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Agent 1's solution: 

Step 1: Determine the number of sprints James runs each time.
James runs 3 sprints each time.

Step 2: Determine the distance of each sprint.
Each sprint is 60 meters long.

Step 3: Calculate the total distance James runs in one session.
To do this, we multiply the number of sprints (3) by the distance of each sprint (60 meters).
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Step 4: Determine how many times James runs each week.
James runs 3 times a week.

Step 5: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.
To do this, we multiply the total distance he runs in one session (180 meters) by the number of times he runs each week (3).
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week
So, James runs a total of 540 meters per week.
The answer is: 540.

### Instruction: 
Use the responses above, answer the following math question.
James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total meters does he run a week?

### Response: Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of sprints James runs each time.
James runs 3 sprints each time.

Step 2: Determine the distance of each sprint.
Each sprint is 60 meters long.

Step 3: Calculate the total distance James runs in one session.
To do this, we multiply the number of sprints (3) by the distance of each sprint (60 meters).
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Step 4: Determine how many times James runs each week.
James runs 3 times a week.

Step 5: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.
To do this, we multiply the total distance he runs in one session (180 meters) by the number of sessions he runs each week (3 times).
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, James runs a total of 540 meters per week.

The answer is: 540
