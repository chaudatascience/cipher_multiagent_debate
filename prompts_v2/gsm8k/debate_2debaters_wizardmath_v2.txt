### Instruction: ```James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total meters does he run a week?```

### Agent 1's solution: ```James runs 3*60*3=1800 meters a week.
Answer: 1800```

### Your solution: ```James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, 3 times a week.
So he runs a total of 3*60*3=540 meters in a week.
Answer: 540```

### Response: ```Let's think step by step. James runs 3 sprints per session, and he does this 3 times a week. So, in one week, he runs a total of 3 * 3 = 9 sprints.
Since each sprint is 60 meters long, James runs a total of 9 * 60 = 540 meters.
Answer: 540```
