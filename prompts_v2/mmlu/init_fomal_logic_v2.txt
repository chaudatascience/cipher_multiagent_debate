Question: ```Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
Elliott likes to skateboard or he likes to write songs and to play them.
A. S ∨ (W • P)
B. (S ∨ W) ∨ P
C. S • (W ∨ P)
D. (S • W) ∨ P```

Solution: ```The sentence is saying that Elliott likes to skateboard or he likes to write songs and play them. This is symbolized by a disjunction (∨), which means "or."
The first disjunct is simply S, which states that Elliott likes to skateboard. The second disjunct is (W • P), which is the conjunction of W and P. This means that Elliott likes to write songs and play them
The best symbolization of the sentence is A. S ∨ (W • P).
Thus, the correct answer choice is A.
Answer: A```

Question: ```Use indirect truth tables to determine whether each set of propositions is consistent. If the set is consistent, choose an option with a consistent valuation. (There may be other consistent valuations.)
(A ∨ B) ∨ C
~C
~A ⊃ B
A. Inconsistent
B. Consistent. Consistent valuation when A and B are true and C is false
C. Consistent. Consistent valuation when A and C are true and B is false
D. Consistent. Consistent valuation when B and C are true and A is false```

Solution: ```We can construct the truth table for this set of propositions as follows:
A | B | C | (A ∨ B) ∨ C | ~C | ~A ⊃ B |
---|---|---|---|---|---|
T | T | F | T | T | T |
T | T | T | T | F | T |
T | F | F | T | T | T |
F | T | F | T | T | T |
F | F | F | T | T | T |
F | F | T | T | F | T |
F | F | T | F | T | F |
The last column of the truth table shows that the set of propositions is consistent. 
Thus, the correct answer choice is B.
Answer: B```

Question: ```Select the best English interpretation of the given proposition, using the following translation key: Ax: x is an apartment Hx: x is a house Lx: x is large Bxy: x is bigger than y (∀x){(Lx • Ax) ⊃ (∃y)[(Hy • ~Ly) • Bxy]}
A. All large apartments are bigger than all houses that are not large.
B. Some house that is not large is bigger than all large apartments.
C. Any apartment bigger than a house that is not large is large.
D. Every large apartment is bigger than some house that is not large.```

Solution: ```We have:
Ax: x is an apartment
Hx: x is a house
Lx: x is large
Bxy: x is bigger than y
We have translation of the proposition:
∀x: For all x.
(Lx • Ax) ⊃: If x is large and x is an apartment, then
(∃y)[(Hy • ~Ly) • Bxy]: there exists a y such that y is a house, y is not large, and x is bigger than y.
This means that for all apartments that are large, there exists a house that is not large that the apartment is bigger than.
Thus, the correct answer choice is D.
Answer: D```
