Question: ```If f : (x, y) → (x + y, 2y – x) for every coordinate pair in the xy-plane, for what points (x, y) is it true that f : (x, y) → (x, y)?
A. (0, 0) only
B. The set of points (x, y) such that x = 0
C. The set of points (x, y) such that y = 0
D. The set of points (x, y) such that x = y```

Agent 1's solution: ```Given that f : (x, y) -> (x + y, 2y – x), we can equate the components of the two tuples:
x + y = x, and
2y - x = y.
Simplifying these equations, we find:
y = 0, and
y = x.
From the equation y = 0, we can conclude that for any value of x, the point (x, 0) will satisfy f, which is closest to answer choice C.
Answer: C```

Your solution: ```The function f maps a point (x, y) to the point (x + y, 2y – x). For f to map a point to itself, we need x + y = x and 2y – x = y. Solving the first equation, we get x = 0. Substituting x = 0 into the second equation, we get y = 0. Therefore, the only point that maps to itself is (0, 0). So the answer is  
(0,0) only, which is closest to answer choice A.
Answer: A```

Correct solution: ```Let's think step by step:
We have that f(x, y) = (x + y, 2y – x).
The only way for this to equal (x, y) is if x + y = x and 2y – x = y.
The first equation simplifies to y = 0, and the second equation simplifies to x = 0.
Therefore, the only point that works is (0,0), closest to answer choice A.

Question: ```Let $h(4x-1) = 2x + 7$. For what value of $x$ is $h(x) = x$?
A. 420
B. 69
C. 7
D. 15```

Agent 1's solution: ```We have that h(4x-1) = 2x + 7. 
Let a=4x-1, then x=(a+1)/4.
Substituting a=4x-1 into the first equation, we get h(a)=2((a+1)/4)+7=(a+1)/2+7=a/2+7.5
We want to find h(a)=a, so we have an equation a/2+7.5=a. 
Solving for a, we get a/2=7.5. This gives a=7.5*2=15, which is closest to answer choice D.
Answer D```

Your solution: ```We are given that h(4x−1)=2x+7. We want to find the value of x such that h(x)=x. 
Substituting x for 4x−1 in the first equation, we get h(x)=2(x−1)+7=x+5.
Solving x+5=x, we get x=5, which is closest to answer choice C.
Answer C```

Correct solution: ```Let's think step by step:
We have the equation $h(4x-1) = 2x + 7$.
Let's define $a = 4x-1$. This implies $x = \frac{a+1}{4}$.
Substituting $a$ into the equation, we have $h(a) = 2\left(\frac{a+1}{4}\right) + 7 = \frac{a}{2} + 7.5$.
Substituting $x$ into $a$, we have  $h(x) =  \frac{x}{2} + 7.5$.
We want $h(x) = x$, thus we can set up the equation $\frac{x}{2} + 7.5 = x$.
Simplifying this equation, we can subtract $\frac{x}{2}$ from both sides:
$7.5 = \frac{x}{2}$.
To solve for $x$, we multiply both sides by $2$:
$2 \times 7.5 = x$.
This gives us $x = 15$, which is closest to answer choice D.
