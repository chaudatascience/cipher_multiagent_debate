Question: ```Group A and Group B each are composed of equal numbers of men and women. Both groups read a prose passage. Group A is told that it was written by a man, and Group B is told that it was written by a woman. Both groups then rate the quality of the prose. What are the likely results
A. The males in Group B will rate the prose as significantly poorer than will the males in Group A
B. The females in Group B will rate the prose as significantly poorer than will the females in Group A
C. Group A will rate the prose as significantly better than will Group B
D. The females in Group A will rate the prose 2s significantly poorer than will the females in Group B; the males in Group A will rare the prose as significantly better than will the males in Group B```

Solution: ```The experiment involves telling each group of participants a different author's gender for the same prose passage. In this case, Group A is told that the passage was written by a man, while Group B is told it was written by a woman. The likely result is that Group A, who believes the passage was written by a man, will rate the prose as better compared to Group B, who believes it was written by a woman. This indicates a potential bias or preconceived notions about the quality of writing based on the author's gender.
Therefore, the answer is C.
Answer: C```
