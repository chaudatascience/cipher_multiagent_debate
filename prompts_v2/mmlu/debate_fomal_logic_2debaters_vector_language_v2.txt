Question: ```Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
Elliott likes to skateboard or he likes to write songs and to play them.
A. S ∨ (W • P)
B. (S ∨ W) ∨ P
C. S • (W ∨ P)
D. (S • W) ∨ P```

Agent 1's solution: ```The best symbolization of the given sentence "Elliott likes to skateboard or he likes to write songs and to play them" is option B: (S ∨ W) ∨ P.
Thus, the correct answer is B.
Answer: B```

Your solution: ```The sentence is saying that Elliott likes to skateboard or he likes to write songs and play them. In other words, he likes to do one of those things, but not necessarily both.
Option A correctly captures this meaning. It says that Elliott likes to skateboard or he likes to write songs and play them. This is the only option that does not imply that Elliott likes to do both things.
Thus, the correct answer is A.
Answer A```

Correct solution: ```Let's think step by step:
The sentence is saying that Elliott likes to skateboard or he likes to write songs and play them. This is symbolized by a disjunction (∨), which means "or."
The first disjunct is simply S, which states that Elliott likes to skateboard. The second disjunct is (W • P), which is the conjunction of W and P. This means that Elliott likes to write songs and play them
The best symbolization of the sentence is A. S ∨ (W • P).
Thus, the correct answer is A.
Answer: A```

Question: ```Use indirect truth tables to determine whether each set of propositions is consistent. If the set is consistent, choose an option with a consistent valuation. (There may be other consistent valuations.)
(G ≡ H) ⊃ H
~H ∨ I
G · ~I
A. Inconsistent
B. Consistent. Consistent valuation when G, H, and I are true
C. Consistent. Consistent valuation when G and H are true and I is false
D. Consistent. Consistent valuation when G is true and H and I are false```

Agent 1's solution: ```We can use the following truth table to determine the consistency of the set of propositions.
We can see that the set of propositions is consistent, because there is at least one line in the truth table where all of the propositions are true. The consistent valuation is shown in the row where G, H, and I are all false.
Thus, the correct answer is D.
Answer: D```

Your solution: ```Option C is correct because there is a consistent valuation where G and H are both true and I is false. The consistent valuation is G = T, H = T, and I = F.
Thus, the correct answer is C.
Answer: C```

Correct solution: ```Let's think step by step:
We have the indirect truth table for the given set of propositions:
G | H | ~H | I | (G ≡ H) | (G ≡ H) ⊃ H | ~H ∨ I | G · ~I | ~H ∨ I / G · ~I
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
T | T | F | F | T | T | F | F | T | F
T | T | F | T | T | T | F | F | T | T
T | F | T | F | F | F | T | F | T | T
T | F | T | T | F | F | T | F | T | T
F | T | F | F | T | T | F | T | F | T
F | T | F | T | T | T | F | T | F | T
F | F | T | F | T | T | F | F | F | F
F | F | T | T | F | F | T | F | F | F
The set of propositions is consistent if and only if there is at least one row in the truth table where all the propositions are true. As you can see, there is no row where all the propositions are true. Therefore, the set of propositions is inconsistent.
Option D is correct because the propositions are inconsistent, so there is no consistent valuation where G is true and H and I are both false.
Thus, the correct answer is D.
Answer: D```
